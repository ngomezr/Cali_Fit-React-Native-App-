1. Opening screen is straight forward, has a nice sliding of pictures on the top.
2. Below it has descriptions of each feature and why we decided to use them and provided links to each page also.
3. I used a Drawer funtion for the user to navigate throughout the app with that as well. (I made a 3 bars on the top left, so it noticable that the app has a drawer function).

    react-redux: We were planning to use this feature on the 'Pomodor Timer' and keep track of the users 'Sessions' and then display them at the end.
                  However, among my group-mates I shared my code and they tried implementing it and everyone kept getting crashes/errors when doing it.
                  Therefore, we didn't implement it because of this but we had an idea. 
                  Error: Usually occured when installing redux on the project.

    ^ For the link it show as 'Not Public' but I shared it among my groupmates and they were able to open it.
    If you are having trouble opening it because of this please let me know. EXPO didn't let me change it to public and still shows as "Not Public".
